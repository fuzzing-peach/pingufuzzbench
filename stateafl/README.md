# StateAFL: A Coverage-Driven (Greybox) Fuzzer for Stateful Network Protocols
StateAFL is a fuzzer designed for network servers. It extends the original idea of the AFL fuzzer, which automatically evolves fuzz inputs to maximize code coverage. In addition to code coverage, StateAFL seeks to maximize protocol state coverage.

The aim of this tool is to contribute towards a completely-automated solution for stateful protocol fuzzing (similarly to what AFL was able to achieve for stateless programs) and to promote a wider application of fuzzing in real-world systems. The fuzzer does not require developers to implement custom message parsers for the protocol under test.

StateAFL automatically infers the current protocol state of the server. At compile-time, it instruments the target server with probes on memory allocations and network I/O operations. At run-time, it takes snapshots of long-lived data within process memory for each protocol iteration (see figure), and it applies fuzzy hashing to map the in-memory state to a unique protocol state.

StateAFL has been implemented on top of the codebase of [AFL](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/) and [AFLnet](https://github.com/aflnet/aflnet). To fuzz a server, it should be compiled using `afl-clang-fast` (using the modified version that is included in this project, not the one from AFL), to perform a compiler pass for instrumenting the target.

# ProFuzzBench

If you want to run some experiments quickly, please take a look at [ProFuzzBench](https://github.com/profuzzbench/profuzzbench). ProFuzzBench includes a suite of representative open-source network servers for popular protocols (e.g., TLS, SSH, SMTP, FTP, SIP), and tools to automate experimentation. StateAFL has been integrated into that benchmark.


# Installation (Tested on Ubuntu 18.04 & 16.04 64-bit)

## Prerequisites

```bash
# Install clang (required by afl-clang-fast)
sudo apt-get install clang
# Install graphviz development
sudo apt-get install graphviz-dev
```

## StateAFL

Download StateAFL and compile it. We have tested StateAFL on Ubuntu 18.04 and Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit and it would also work on all environments that support the vanilla AFL and [graphviz](https://graphviz.org).

```bash
# First, clone this StateAFL repository to a folder named stateafl
git clone <links to the repository> stateafl
# Then move to the source code folder
cd stateafl
make clean all
cd llvm_mode
# The following make command may not work if llvm-config cannot be found
# To fix this issue, just set the LLVM_CONFIG env. variable to the specific llvm-config version on your machine
# On Ubuntu 18.04, it could be llvm-config-6.0 if you have installed clang using apt-get
make
# Move to StateAFL's parent folder
cd ../..
export STATEAFL=$(pwd)/stateafl
```

## Setup PATH environment variables

```bash
export PATH=$STATEAFL:$PATH
export AFL_PATH=$STATEAFL
```

# Usage

StateAFL can be run using the same command line options of AFL and AFLNet (except for protocol specification). Run ```afl-fuzz --help``` to see all options. Please also see [README-AFLnet.md](README-AFLnet.md) for more information.

- ***-i folder***: folder with input files, in replayable format (see below)

- ***-N netinfo***: server information (e.g., tcp://127.0.0.1/8554)

- ***-P protocol***: (optional, for cross-checking protocol state machine against AFLNet) application protocol to be tested (e.g., RTSP, FTP, DTLS12, DNS, DICOM, SMTP, SSH, TLS, DAAP-HTTP, SIP)

- ***-D usec***: (optional) waiting time (in microseconds) for the server to complete its initialization 

- ***-K*** : (optional) send SIGTERM signal to gracefully terminate the server after consuming all request messages

- ***-E*** : (optional) enable state aware mode

- ***-R*** : (optional) enable region-level mutation operators

- ***-F*** : (optional) enable false negative reduction mode

- ***-c script*** : (optional) name or full path to a script for server cleanup

- ***-q algo***: (optional) state selection algorithm (e.g., 1. RANDOM_SELECTION, 2. ROUND_ROBIN, 3. FAVOR)

- ***-s algo***: (optional) seed selection algorithm (e.g., 1. RANDOM_SELECTION, 2. ROUND_ROBIN, 3. FAVOR)

- ***-u path to "vanilla" executable***: (optional) if this is provided, StateAFL uses two forkservers, for better performance: one for profiling the code coverage (by running an input on the target executable indicated in "-u", which can be the same executable that would be used in AFLNet/AFLnwe); and another for profiling the protocol state (by running the executable compiled with StateAFL's afl-clang-fast)

- ***-U path to folder***: (optional) working directory where to run the "vanilla" executable (see option -u)


Example command: 
```bash
afl-fuzz -d -i in -o out -N <server info> -x <dictionary file> -D 10000 -q 3 -s 3 -E -K -R <executable binary and its arguments (e.g., port number)>
```

# Preparing the seed inputs

StateAFL takes in input seed files in "replayable" format. It is a simple format also used in AFLNet for replaying inputs (i.e., the ones saves in `replayable-queue` and `replayable-crashes` within the output folder), using the command `aflnet-replay`. The format alternates the size of a message (4 bytes, unsigned int) and the contents of that message.

![Network replay format](images/replay-format.png)

You can automatically generate seed files from PCAP traces, as follows:

```bash
$ python3 convert-pcap-replay-format.py --input ftp_requests_full_normal.pcap --server-port 2200 --output ftp_requests_full_normal.replay

Converted PCAP saved to ftp_requests_full_normal.replay

$ hexdump -C ftp_requests_full_normal.replay

```

The PCAP file should only contain one message flow between the server and a client. Both TCP and UDP are supported. If the PCAP contains multiple message flows, you can use the options `--client-port` and `--ignore-multiple-clients` to pick a specific flow and ignore the others. To run the conversion script, you need to install the [pyshark](https://github.com/KimiNewt/pyshark) Python package, and the [tshark](https://tshark.dev/) tool. It is **not required** that the protocol under test can be parsed by tshark. The script only extracts the raw payload from TCP or UDP traffic.

# Demo

The following demo shows how to use StateAFL on an FTP server. It starts from collecting the PCAP from a simple client-server session. The PCAP is then converted in "replayable" format, and seeded to StateAFL. StateAFL incrementally builds a Finite State Machine of the protocol from the in-memory states of the FTP server.
